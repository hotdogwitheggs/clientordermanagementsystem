This system has 3 user roles

The user which can navigate around the home page, find a designer and browse
the services that they can provide. They are also able to specify a title 
and give a due date.

The designer role is able to access a project manager where they can see
incoming, pending, and completed orders to keep track of them. They can also
add their own service that they are capable of as well as specify what order
type they could be. For example, Graphic Design service, Logos, Posters, Tshirt
Designs for order type.

The admin role is able to manage designers and approve designer requests to 
users. They can also remove designers from their roles and they have the ability
to look at the orders to see if the designers are doing their work.
